## Tips
- If you can do the task without reflection, don't use reflecion.
- Because the lack of compile time optimization, code with reflection is way slower than code without it
- Reflection misused may lead to bugs hard to find during coding
- Code with reflection may be more difficult to be fully covered by tests
